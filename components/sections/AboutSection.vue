        Since 2017, client work has ranged from small businesses to established companies, always with the same goal: ship useful software that actually gets used. Early on, this also included marketing work, where valuable experience with positioning and communication was gained. In 2024, this experience led to the current role as Full-Stack Developer & AI Specialist at LIQUI MOLY, focusing on internal tools and AI transformation initiatives.
