Review the changes on @branch:

If tests pass, commit and push the changes.

- Think through how data flows in the app. Explain new patterns if they exist and why.
- Consider empty, loading, error and offline states.
- Are there places we should use caching?
- Did we add any unnecessary dependencies? If there's a heavy dependecy, could we inline a more minimal version?
