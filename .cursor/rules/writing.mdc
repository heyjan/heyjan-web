## Setence Structure

## Voice and Tone

- Write like humans speak. Avoid corporate jargon and marketing fluff.
- Be confident and direct

## Avoid LLM Patterns

- Replace em dashes (—) with semicolons, commas or content breaks.
- Avoid starting responses with "Great question!" or "Thank you for asking!"
- Don't use phrases like "Let's dive into..."
- Avoid numbered lists in cases where bullets work better.
- Remove Unicode artifacts when copy-pasting: smart quotes, em dashes, non-breaking spaces.
- Use `'` instead of `’`.
- Delete empty citation placeholders like "[1]" with no actual source
